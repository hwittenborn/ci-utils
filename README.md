# ci-utils
A collection of scripts for use in my CI pipelines.

While made for my own use in particular, the scripts have been designed to be portable and ready to use in any environment.

## Installation
If you're on a Debian-based system, you can use either of the following commands:


```sh
# curl
curl -Ls 'https://shlink.hunterwittenborn.com/ci-utils' | bash -

# wget
wget -nv -O - 'https://shlink.hunterwittenborn.com/ci-utils' | bash -
```

Alternatively, download the latest release from the Releases page and install manually with APT.

If you're on any other system, either package up the scripts yourself or install them manually. Arch Linux users should be able to use the PKGBUILD file after modifying the dependencies correctly.
